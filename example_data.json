    "start_state":"Thomas has 4 elder sisters, James has 2 elder sisters and 1 younger sister. Thomas and James share the same father and mother. What's the relationship between Thomas and James?",
    "solution":"1. Correct Identification of Relationship (40 points) - 40 points: The solution correctly identifies that Thomas and James are brothers and provides a clear, logical explanation of why this is the case. - 30-39 points: The solution identifies Thomas and James as brothers but has minor flaws or gaps in explaining how this conclusion was reached. - 20-29 points: The solution identifies the relationship incorrectly (e.g., cousins or unrelated), but there is some reasoning present that shows partial understanding of the problem. - 0-19 points: The solution does not identify the correct relationship and shows little or no reasoning in arriving at the answer. 2. Understanding of Sibling Relationships (30 points) - 30 points: The solution shows a clear understanding of the family dynamics (4 elder sisters for Thomas, 2 elder and 1 younger sister for James) and correctly factors this into the reasoning process. - 20-29 points: The solution shows a mostly correct understanding of the family dynamics but may omit or misinterpret some information, such as the number of siblings or relative ages. - 10-19 points: The solution demonstrates a basic understanding but has major errors in interpreting the sibling relationships. - 0-9 points: The solution fails to demonstrate any understanding of the sibling relationships. 3. Logical Reasoning (20 points) - 20 points: The solution follows a coherent and logical structure, with clear steps leading to the conclusion. All pieces of information are used effectively. - 15-19 points: The solution follows mostly logical reasoning, though there may be minor gaps or assumptions that weaken the argument. - 10-14 points: The solution shows some attempt at logical reasoning, but there are significant gaps or inconsistencies in the thought process. - 0-9 points: The solution lacks logical structure or fails to follow a coherent reasoning path. 4. Clarity and Presentation (10 points) - 10 points: The solution is clearly written, well-organized, and easy to follow. The steps are presented in a logical order. - 7-9 points: The solution is mostly clear but may have minor issues in organization or phrasing that affect readability. - 4-6 points: The solution is somewhat unclear, with disorganized or confusing presentation, though the overall argument can still be understood. - 0-3 points: The solution is poorly written, disorganized, or very difficult to understand. 5. Consideration of Potential Complications (Bonus 5 points) - 5 points (bonus): The solution considers possible complications or ambiguities in the problem (e.g., the discrepancy between the numbers of sisters) and addresses them thoughtfully. - 0 points: No consideration of complications or ambiguities. Total: 100 points"
